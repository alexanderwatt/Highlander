# Highlander
The core of Highlander is a central  real-time event management cache for financial derivatives and securities. This includes commodity, interest rate, foreign exchange, equity, inflation and property.

Additionally, there are a number of trading applications, which deliver pricing and risk management capabilities. 
However, the sweet thing about this cache is that the underlying data acrchitecture is primarliy FpML(5.3, but 
extended with the JPMorgan classes for securities).

As well as valuing all Reporting and Confirmation trades, FpML PricingStructure and PricingStructureValuation classes are used extensively.

A wide range of OTC and Exchange traded derivatives can be vlaued and risk managed real-time.

The next goal will be to incorporate FpML 5.10 and 5.11 into the architecture.
