A real-time derivatives system cache.
There are additionally a bunch of trading applications, but the sweet thing about this cache is that
the underlying data acrchitecture is FpML 5.3 extended with the JPMorgan classes for securities.
As well as valuing all Reporting and Confirmation trades. This is based on the enxtensive use of 
the PricingStructure and PricingStructureValuation classes in FpML.
A range of OTS and Exchange traded derivatives can be vlaued and risk managed real-time.

The next goal will be to incorporate FpML 5.10 into the architecture.
